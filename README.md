## Dependencies
Dependencies to install with pip:
```
requests
Tweepy
Bs4
```

## Steps
1. First of all you need is to create a Twitter developer account so you can get access to the twitter api and get the  Api Keys it's pretty simple it will just take a few minutes so do it first.

2. If you want to use the same account that you used to create your twitter developer then you will get all the keys from the developer portal BUT if you want to use another account for the bot, You need to use the Token Generator script to get the tokens.

3. Now we need to get the pictures that we will use. In my case i used "Reddit_Bot.py" to scrapp Art pictures From reddit but you're free to use whatever the method you want.

4. After that we need to get the quotes for our captions. I used a "Quotes_Scrapper" to scrapp A website called "Brainyquote.com" to get my quotes it was quite easy you can use the script too if you want.

5. And now let's get to the Twitter Bot, i made all the instructions in the script.

6. Finally what i did is I put my script in a linux server so it can be automated and run 24/7 without me i suggest you do the same.
